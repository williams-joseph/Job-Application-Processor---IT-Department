## Troubleshooting

### "Tesseract not found"
- Ensure Tesseract is installed
- Update `TESSERACT_PATH` in `extractor.py` to match your installation path

### "Permission denied" on Excel file
- Close the Excel file before processing
- Ensure you have write permissions

### Slow processing
- PDFs with scanned images take longer (OCR)
- Consider processing in smaller batches
